**Status:** Preregistered / Finalized
**Theory Basis:** W-Structure ($\alpha$-free, discrete information model)
**Core Principle:** Information Genesis (Growth) & Density Gradient.

## 1. Fundamental Paradigm Shift

The standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) is superseded by the **W-Genesis Model**. We reject the axioms of inflation, dark energy, and metric expansion of space in favor of a model based on discrete growth and medium density evolution.

### 1.1. Process Topology
* **Space does not expand.** Galactic coordinates within the global grid are fixed. New cells are **not** inserted between existing objects.
* **Space is born.** The generation of new cells occurs exclusively at the "Front" (edge) of the system via the $0 \to W$ phase transition.
* **The Recession Illusion:** Observed galactic "recession" and redshift are consequences of increasing **informational density of the space** (from Front to Center) and the changing permeability of the medium, not a physical increase in distance.

### 1.2. The Nature of Time
* **Global Time ($T_{sys}$):** An absolute counter of "ticks" (generations) of cell genesis at the Front.
* **Local Time ($\tau$):** Dependent on medium density. In dense clusters (matter/center), local time flows slower relative to the global tick due to high informational resistance (processing lag).

## 2. Information Transmission Speed (W-Speed)

The speed of light $c$ is not a fundamental constant because the vacuum is inhomogeneous (it possesses a density gradient).

### 2.1. Calculation of True Speed ($V_{front}$)
Based on the "Hubble Tension" (the discrepancy between $H_{local} \approx 73$ and $H_{CMB} \approx 67.4$), we calculate the conductivity gradient of the medium.

* **$c_{local}$ (observed):** $\approx 299,792$ km/s (speed in the dense environment of the "Center").
* **Gradient Coefficient:** $\approx 1.166$ (conductivity difference between the dense Center and the pure Front).

**Fundamental Space Growth Speed (Genesis Speed):**
$$V_{front} \approx 350,000 \text{ km/s} \quad (3.5 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})$$

*Implication:* Redshift ($z$) is a measure of signal "braking" as it passes through the increasing density of the medium, rather than a Doppler effect.

## 3. Chronology and Geometry

Eliminating fictitious "inflation" allows for the recalculation of the system's real parameters.

### 3.1. Real Age ($T_{real}$)
The standard estimate (13.8 billion years) is inflated because it fails to account for the higher speed of processes in the past (in a less dense medium).
Adjusting for $V_{avg} \to V_{front}$:

**Age of the Universe:**
$$T_{real} \approx 11.4 \text{ billion years}$$
*(Global ticks count $\approx 10^{61}$)*.

### 3.2. Physical Radius ($R_W$)
The radius is calculated as the product of real time and the genesis speed at the front.
$$R_W = T_{real} \times V_{front}$$

**Sphere Radius:**
$$R_W \approx 1.26 \times 10^{26} \text{ meters}$$
*(Equivalent to $\approx 13.3$ billion light-years in local units).*

> **Note:** The Universe is a compact, causally closed sphere. The radius coincides with the event horizon.

## 4. Discrete Metrics (Hardware Specs)

Planck units ($l_P, t_P$) are inaccurate as they are anchored to the local (slowed) speed of light. The true resolution of reality is higher.

### 4.1. Minimum Distance ($l_W$)
The size of a single information cell (graph edge):
$$l_W \approx 1.28 \times 10^{-35} \text{ meters}$$
*(Resolution is ~20% higher than Planck length).*

### 4.2. Minimum Time ($t_W$)
The duration of one phase transition (clock rate):
$$t_W \approx 3.66 \times 10^{-44} \text{ seconds}$$
*(System operates ~30% faster than Planck time).*

### 4.3. Informational Capacity ($N$)
The Universe is treated as a volumetric crystal (Volume Packing).
* **Linear Resolution:** $R_W / l_W \approx 10^{61}$ cells.
* **Total Matrix Capacity:**
    $$N_{total} \approx (10^{61})^3 = 10^{183} \text{ cells (nats)}$$

## 5. The Fundamental Law (The Only Law)

The entire structure, from micro to macro levels, is governed by a single logical imperative:

**PAN-Principle (Principle of Absolute Non-Contradiction)**
> *The Universe is a self-consistent information structure where only those states and evolutions are possible and stable that do not lead to logical contradictions (both locally and globally).*

* **Evolution Engine:** The realization of Potential (0) via Variability (V) subject to the absence of Contradiction (C).
* **The Only Constant:** The limit of informational complexity (threshold $Kw$) determining the phase transition point.
